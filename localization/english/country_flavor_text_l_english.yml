 PLC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Since the Constitution of May 3rd, the Commonwealth has endured a relentless gauntlet of fire, from Napoleonic dreams to the "Miracle on the Bug." The Treaty of Minsk secured our independence but at a devastating cost, leaving the nation bled white and forced to pay a humiliating tribute to the Tsar. Having lost one-sixth of its population, Poland stands weakened and burdened by debt, yet its industrial heart in West Galicia beats with a fierce, vengeful rhythm. The Eagle is scarred and grounded for now, but its eyes are fixed on the empires that sought to bury it. Now, the time has come to transform blood into steel and reclaim our stolen destiny."
 COU_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Nested on the Baltic coast, the Duchy of Courland remains a loyal, if weary, sentinel of the Polish Crown. While the Great Powers look upon this small land as a mere stepping stone, its ports and shipyards remain vital arteries for the Commonwealth’s northern trade. Bound by ancient feudal ties and modern necessity, Courland must navigate the treacherous waters between Russian ambition and Polish loyalty. For the Duchy, survival depends on the strength of its suzerain and the sharp winds of Baltic commerce."
