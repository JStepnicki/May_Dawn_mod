# 🌅 May Dawn
### *Survival is not victory. It is only the beginning of the struggle.*

**May Dawn** is an alternate history total conversion mod for **Victoria 3**, exploring a world in which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth narrowly avoided total annihilation during the partitions.

Survival, however, came at a horrifying cost.

This is not a story of revival or a new Golden Age.  
This is the story of a state trapped in permanent crisis — modernizing under coercion, drowning in debt, and living under the constant shadow of Russian bayonets.

## 📜 Lore – The Bitter Taste of Reform

The year **1791** brought no peace.

The **Constitution of May 3rd** was ratified, but its enforcement fractured the Commonwealth from within. The magnates, stripped of the *liberum veto*, resisted with conspiracies and sabotage, while early attempts to place the peasantry under legal protection ignited bloody uprisings across the eastern latifundia.

When Napoleon rose over Europe, Poland embraced him — not out of admiration, but desperation.

The alliance with France restored **Greater Poland** and **Danzig**, but transformed the Commonwealth into a vast military camp. Every horse, every sack of grain, every able-bodied man was sacrificed to sustain the Emperor’s wars.

## ⚔️ The Miracle on the Bug & the Blood Border

In **1812**, as the Grande Armée froze and collapsed in Russia, Poland became the last line of resistance.

The so-called **“Miracle on the Bug”** was no glorious triumph. It was a massacre.  
Fragments of the Crown Army, peasant scythe-men, and urban militias stopped the Russian advance through sheer exhaustion and bloodshed.

The peace that followed was merciless.

The Commonwealth survived — but lost its **“eastern lungs.”**  
**Minsk and Kiev** were absorbed by the Tsardom and transformed into fortress-cities aimed directly at Warsaw.

Today, the eastern frontier is a **Death Zone** — a scarred no-man’s-land where peace is merely an intermission before the next inevitable war.

## 🗺️ 1836 – A State of Iron and Mud

You begin the game in **1836**, with the Napoleonic Wars barely behind you and catastrophe looming ahead.

### Key Starting Conditions

- **The Constitution in Practice**  
  Progressive laws exist — on paper. In reality, the Sejm is a battlefield of ancient noble houses, corrupt officials, and an emerging but fragile bourgeoisie.

- **The Social Cauldron**  
  Peasants are “under legal protection,” yet forced labor persists. Rural unrest is nearing detonation.  
  Burghers possess rights, but lack the capital necessary to industrialize the state.

- **Existential Threats**  
  - **Prussia** covets Danzig  
  - **Austria** dreams of reclaiming Kraków  
  - **Russia** waits patiently for a single moment of weakness

Independence is temporary. Collapse is always an option.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

**May Dawn** is not about easy power fantasy.

It is about:
- Delaying inevitable wars
- Balancing reform with internal stability
- Choosing *which* part of society will bleed next

Victory is never permanent.  
Independence must be renegotiated every decade.

## ❓ Will You Endure?

Can you:
- Maintain fragile independence among predatory empires?

Or will the ticking bomb of social reform tear the Commonwealth apart from within?
