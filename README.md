# 🌅 May Dawn: A Commonwealth (Poland–Lithuania)

> **"Because we do not beg for freedom, we fight for it."**
> — *Witold Urbanowicz*

**May Dawn** is an alternate-history total conversion mod for **Victoria 3**, exploring a world where the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth never disappeared — it endured, reformed, and survived against overwhelming odds.

Instead of partitions and extinction, the Commonwealth enters **1836** wounded, indebted, and heavily militarized — a nation balanced between rebirth and collapse.

---

## 📜 Lore — A Bitter Independence

### The Turning Point: 1791

In this timeline, the **Targowica Confederation** was crushed. Reform triumphed — but unity did not survive victory. The Commonwealth transformed into a fortress state, permanently preparing for the next invasion.

When Napoleon rose, Poland saw opportunity rather than ideology — a chance for vengeance and restoration.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Commonwealth successfully reclaimed:

* **Galicia** from Austria
* **Royal Prussia** from the Hohenzollerns

But history still demanded its price.

The **1812 march on Moscow** ended in the same frozen catastrophe. As the Grande Armée collapsed, the Polish Crown Army was left isolated, exhausted, and alone.

---

## ⚔️ The Miracle on the Bug & Treaty of Minsk (1814)

Victory never came — only survival.

Peasant scythe-men and shattered regular forces halted the Russian advance through desperation and exhaustion. The resulting peace became a calculated humiliation designed to cripple the Commonwealth permanently.

### Consequences of the Treaty

#### 🗺️ The Shattered East

Borders reverted roughly to the First Partition, with additional territorial losses pushing the frontier westward.

#### 💰 The Debt Trap

Massive reparations to St. Petersburg continue draining the treasury in 1836.

#### 🔥 Scorched Borderlands

The **Kresy** became a militarized wasteland — an integrated no-man’s-land between empires.

The Commonwealth survives — but barely.

### ⚔️ Internal Stability & The Nobility

### 🌍 Ethnic & Frontier Management

#### The Kresy Revitalization

Journal Entries focused on rebuilding the devastated eastern frontier:

* Migration incentives
* State investment
* Modernization projects

### 🚩 The Grand Vengeance (Late Game)

Long-term strategic objectives allowing the Commonwealth to dismantle the partitioning powers, including:

* Breaking the Austrian Empire
* Supporting independence movements in:

  * Czechia
  * Hungary
  * Croatia

---
