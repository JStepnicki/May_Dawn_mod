🌅 May Dawn: A Commonwealth (Poland–Lithuania)

"Because we do not beg for freedom, we fight for it." - Witold Urbanowicz

May Dawn is an alternate-history total conversion mod for Victoria 3 exploring a world where the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth did not disappear — it endured, reformed, and survived against overwhelming odds.

Instead of partitions and extinction, the Commonwealth emerges into 1836 wounded, indebted, and militarized — a state balanced between rebirth and collapse.

📜 Lore — A Bitter Independence

The year 1791 changed everything.

In this timeline, the Targowica Confederation was crushed. Reform triumphed — but unity did not survive the victory. The Commonwealth became a fortress state, constantly preparing for the next invasion.

When Napoleon rose, Poland saw opportunity rather than ideology — a chance for vengeance and restoration.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Commonwealth successfully reclaimed:

Galicia from Austria

Royal Prussia from the Hohenzollerns

But history still demanded its price.

The 1812 march on Moscow ended in the same frozen catastrophe. As the Grande Armée collapsed, the Polish Crown Army was left isolated, exhausted, and alone.

⚔️ The Miracle on the Bug & Treaty of Minsk (1814)

Victory never came — only survival.

Peasant scythe-men and shattered regular forces halted the Russian advance through sheer exhaustion and desperation. The resulting peace became a calculated humiliation meant to cripple the Commonwealth permanently.

Consequences of the Treaty:

The Shattered East
Borders reverted roughly to the First Partition — with further territorial losses pushing the frontier westward.

The Debt Trap
Massive reparations to St. Petersburg continue draining the treasury in 1836.

Scorched Borderlands
The Kresy became a militarized wasteland — an integrated No-Man’s-Land between empires.

The Commonwealth survives — but barely.
